The Classification of Exception is as follows :-

Checked(Run-Time) and UnChecked (Compile Time)


Throwable
      ----      Error
                ----      StackOverFlowError
                ----      VirtualMachineError
                ----      OutOfMemoryError
      -----    Exception
                      IOException
                      SQLException
                      ClassNotFoundException
                      RuntimeException
                                  Arithmetic Exception
                                  NullPointerException
                                  NumberFormatException
                                  IndexOutOfBoundException
                                              ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
                                              StringIndexOutOfBoundException

Checked Exception

The classes that extend Throwable class except RuntimeException and Error are known as checked exceptions 
e.g.IOException, SQLException etc. Checked exceptions are checked at compile-time.


Unchecked Exception
The classes that extend RuntimeException are known as unchecked exceptions e.g. ArithmeticException, NullPointerException,
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException etc. Unchecked exceptions are not checked at compile-time rather they are checked at runtime.


Error
Error is irrecoverable e.g. OutOfMemoryError, VirtualMachineError, AssertionError etc.





There are 5 keywords used in java exception handling.

try
catch
finally
throw
throws


Try code takes the code be tested for the exception
catch block
      try and catch block between these two block there should not be anything
      In the catch clause, specify the types of exceptions that block can handle, and separate each exception type with a vertical bar (|):

      catch (IOException|SQLException ex) {
          logger.log(ex);
          throw ex;
      }
      Note: If a catch block handles more than one exception type, then the catch parameter is implicitly final. 
      In this example, the catch parameter ex is final and therefore you cannot assign any values to it within the catch block.
      
      
  The finally block is a key tool for preventing resource leaks. When closing a file or otherwise
  recovering resources, place the code in a finally block to ensure that resource is always recovered.
